# Readme

## BIG NONO:
Please do not touch any files in workflows unless you're part of the development team (aka: not a content creator).
Any changes there might disrupt the workflow, which will lead to a lot of confused/angry students & teachers.

## Repo structure:
- **.github:** stuff for the workflows.  Please do not touch (see above).
- **startcode:** where you put the starter code for students.
  Important to know: only code in this folder will be zipped.
  Which is also why the .gitignore is repeated here.
- **readme/.gitignore/license**: pretty much exactly what it says.

## Code formatting:
Please respect the following format rules in our Python code which is seen by students:
- **Dutch variable & function names**: we want to prevent a students mastery of English being a barrier to learning.
- **snake_case**: we follow the Python standard of snake_casing.
- **Please do not start file names with a number**: This complicates things for replit (some students use this instead of pycharm).
